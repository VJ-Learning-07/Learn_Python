-comment out a line - ctrl + /

-priority (PEMDAS RULE)(parentheses , exponent , multiply , divide , add ,subtract)
use three single quotes to print multi line string print('''      ''') - can use for ascii art

- A group of functions saved to a file , is called Module(can create our own modules file and import them in our programs like other modules and use functions in it


- random.randint(a, b) , which returns a random integer between a and b
-random.random() ,To generate random floating-point numbers b/w 0 and 1
-random.uniform(a, b) , returns a random floating-point number between a and b


-extend() adds multiple items from another list to the end.

-random.choice() , allows us to select a random item from a sequence, such as a list.
 

- loop in list
for list_item in list:

-sum()  which allows us to put in any iterable data type, including lists. ex-- sum(list)
-max() to find max value  ex - max(list)
	
-random.shuffle(list) - to shuffle items

-        ''.join(list)  - to concatenate all characters of list into a string

- in statement - can check if a character or statement in anything - ex-   if "-"   in string	 

- in fxn parameter is the name of the data that is being passed in and argument is the actual value of the data
- (The order of arguments in a function call determines which parameter they are assigned to, known as positional arguments.
Using keyword arguments allows for explicit assignment of values to parameters, regardless of order.
Keyword arguments can help make code less error-prone, especially when functions have multiple parameters.)example(a=1, b=2, c=3)
greetwith(name="Angela", location="London")
greetwith(location="London", name="Angela")


- The count() method returns the number of elements with the specified value.             -    list.count(value)

-The Python index() function helps find the position of a letter in the alphabet list, which is crucial for shifting letters.

- the Python string method .title(), which converts each word in a string to start with a capital letter.



-A function can have multiple return statements, and the first return encountered ends the function execution.
-Code after a return statement within the same function does not execute.
-An empty return statement can be used to exit a function early without returning a value.
-Returning meaningful messages on early exit helps developers understand the function's behavior.

-Docstrings provide a way to document functions and blocks of code directly within Python. It is enclosed within three quotation marks ("""). Inside these triple quotes, you write your documentation.

-To use the dictionary to perform a calculation, access the function by its key and call it with the required numbers. For example, to multiply 4 by 8 using the dictionary:
ex-result = operations["*"](4, 8)
print(result)  # Output: 32


 The remove() function searches for the first instance of the specified element and removes it from the list.

-Select the whole code and press tab to indent it completely
